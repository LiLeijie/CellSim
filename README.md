# CellSim
CellSim is a software aims to calculate the similarity among different cells and predict their cell types based on networks.<br>
As an outstanding software, CellSim (Cell Similarity) can provide following services for researchers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Calculate similarity among all human cells.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Provide the common regulation networks of query cell types downloaded (partial support).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Provide cell type-specific regulation networks downloaded (partial support).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Predict the cell type according to offered query gene list.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The predict result (figures and table) support download.<br>

## Installation Instructions
There are two way to run CellSim:<br>
First one is to run code in python3 (3.5 is better). Pyqt5(5.8.1) and matplotlib(2.0.0) should be installed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Install pyqt5:</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ sudo pip3 install pyqt5<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Install matplotlib:</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ sudu pip3 install matplotlib<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Run CellSim:</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ python3 CellSim.pyw<br>
<br>
The other is to click executable files in download archive files on the website (as noted above).
